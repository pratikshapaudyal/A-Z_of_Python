# Concatenation

## What is Concatenation?
Concatenation means to add 2 strings together, or from the RealPython definition which I like "gluing together".

The '+' character is used to concatenate.

**TypeError**

If you try to concatenate a string and an int you will get a `TypeError`:

```bash
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

You will need to convert the int to a str first. 

**join()**

You can concatenate a list of strings to a string using the 'join' method.
